- **Architected Container Security Framework & Security Policies:** Spearheaded unified container-scanning framework, standardizing vulnerability checks for Docker images across all development teams while designing and enforcing security policies to achieve 100% compliance and accelerate remediation cycles.

- **Orchestrated CI/CD-Native Security Enforcement:** Integrated container security scans into CI/CD pipelines automating checks that block non-compliant images and improving vulnerability detection by 50%.

- **Led Container Scanning Tool Evaluation:** Conducted comparative analysis of industry tools across detection accuracy, performance impact, cost, and API support, and piloting top choice to boost scan throughput without affecting pipeline SLAs.

- **Architected End-to-End Third-Party Vendor Image Scanning Framework:** Designed comprehensive security solution including automated CI/CD Pipeline templates, and developer documentation, establishing standardized onboarding workflow for external vendor container images across the organization.

- **Built Intelligent Vulnerability Deduplication & Differentiation System:** Engineered an automated CVE-, package name-, and version-based deduplication solution across Container and SCA scanners and developed an image layer-based vulnerability analysis system—eliminating duplicate findings, reducing alert fatigue, and improving patch efficiency by 30%.

- **Led Cross-Language Vulnerability Research:** Investigated and documented complex security scenarios including Go vulnerabilities appearing in Node.js applications and build-time versus runtime exploitability, providing clarity on risk assessment and remediation prioritization.

- **Researched Supply Chain Attack Prevention:** Evaluated and documented malicious package detection capabilities in JFrog Xray policies, establishing additional security layers for preventing supply chain attacks in containerized environments.

- **Developed Comprehensive Container Security Documentation Hub:** Established a centralized knowledge hub, authored key  Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for container scanning, and created technical integration docs for JFrog Xray and Harness OPA policies—reducing onboarding time by 40% and streamlining security operations.
