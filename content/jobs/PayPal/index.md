- **Architected Container Security Framework & Security Policies:** Spearheaded unified container-scanning framework and governance model, standardizing vulnerability checks for Docker images across all development teams while designing and enforcing JFrog Xray policies (severity gates, CVE exemptions, whitelists) to achieve 100% compliance and accelerate remediation cycles.

- **Orchestrated CI/CD-Native Security Enforcement:** Integrated JFrog Xray container security scans into Harness CI/CD pipelines at both build and deploy stages, automating checks that block non-compliant images and improving vulnerability detection by 50%.

- **Led Container Scanning Tool Evaluation:** Directed comparative analysis of industry tools (JFrog Xray, Trivy, Grype) against criteria including detection accuracy, performance impact, cost, and API supportâ€”piloting top choice to boost scan throughput without affecting pipeline SLAs.
