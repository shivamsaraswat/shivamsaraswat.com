- **Container Security Framework & Policy Development:** Defined and rolled out a unified container—scanning framework and governance model—standardizing vulnerability checks for Docker images across all development teams—while designing and enforcing JFrog Xray policies (severity gates, CVE exemptions, whitelists) to ensure 100\% compliance, reduce manual exception handling, and accelerate remediation cycles.
- **CI/CD—Native Security Enforcement:** Embedded JFrog Xray container security scans into Harness CI/CD pipelines at both build and deploy stages, automating checks that block non-compliant images and accelerating vulnerability detection.
- **Container Scanning Tool Evaluation:** Led a comparative analysis of industry tools (e.g., JFrog Xray, Trivy, Grype) against criteria like detection accuracy, performance impact, cost, and API support—piloting the top choice to boost scan throughput without affecting pipeline SLAs.
